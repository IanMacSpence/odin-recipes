<h3>A recipe inspired by Dexter</h3>
<p>
    Dexter attempted a passive studying technique for his French exam the next day. Unfortunately,
    his plan didn't work out so well and his brain was conditioned to only say <em>"omelette du fromage"</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In a stroke of luck, the test went perfectly with all the answers to the test being the
    very phrase that was stuck in his head. 
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps after trying this recipe, the only thing stuck on your mind for the whole day will also
    be <em>"omelette du fromage"</em>.
