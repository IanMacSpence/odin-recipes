<h3>A recipe inspired by Dexter</h3>
<p>
    Dexter attempted a passive studying technique for his French exam the next day. Unfortunately,
    his plan didn't work out so well and his brain was conditioned to only say <em>"omelette du fromage"</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In a stroke of luck, the test went perfectly with all the answers to the test being the
    very phrase that was stuck in his head. 
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps after trying this recipe, the only thing stuck on your mind for the whole day will also
    be <em>"omelette du fromage"</em>.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt and white pepper. 
        Whisk for a few minutes until egg mixture is foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.

        Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line in the middle of the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then slide omelette onto plate.
